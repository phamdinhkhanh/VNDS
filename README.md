# VNDS package
## Installation
In order to install VNDS package, we must use `devtools` which is specific package for install github reposit in R. In case your computer have not yet had `devtools`, let install it as below:

```
install.packages("devtools")
```
Because of `devtools` is available in cran so we can use command `install.packages()` for installation. But for `VNDS` package we just remain in develop mode. So you have to install though `devtools` as following:

```
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("phamdinhkhanh/VNDS")
```

When you get error in installation, kindly report us according to bug issues link: [github](https://github.com/phamdinhkhanh/VNDS/issues).
